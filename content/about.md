I'm a Senior Software Engineer with a focus on backend technologies. I specialize in distributed systems architecture, database management, scalable REST APIs, Python, and AWS.

I've held senior roles at multiple organizations, including Verizon, EAB, and currently Anaconda.

I'm passionate about clean code, knowledge sharing and writing, and I'm using this blog as an opportunity to showcase and further develop these skills.

This website is free of ads, affiliate links, tracking, analytics, sponsored posts, and paywalls. My goal is to create a no bs, content-first blog where I can freely share what I've learned over the years.

Website is powered by [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and [PaperMod](https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod) and hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).
