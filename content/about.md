I'm a senior software engineer mainly focusing on backend technologies. I specialize in distributed systems architecture, database management, scalable REST APIs, and AWS.

I've worked in senior positions at organizations like Verizon, EAB and currently Anaconda.

I'm passionate about clean code, teaching and writing, and I'm using this blog as an opportunity to showcase and further develop these skills.

This website has no ads, no affiliate links, no tracking or analytics, no sponsored posts, and no paywall. The idea was to create a no bs blog where I freely share what I've learned throughout the years.
