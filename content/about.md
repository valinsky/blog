I'm a senior software engineer with a focus on backend technologies. I specialize in distributed systems architecture, database management, scalable REST APIs, and AWS. I solve most problems in Python, though I don't shy away from any language that gets the job done.

I've held senior roles at multiple organizations, including Verizon, EAB, and currently Anaconda.

I'm passionate about clean code, knowledge sharing and writing, and I'm using this blog as an opportunity to showcase and further develop these skills.

This website **is free of ads, affiliate links, sponsored posts, paywalls, and google analytics.** My goal is to create a no-bs, content-first blog where I can freely share what I've learned over the years.
